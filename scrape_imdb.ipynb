       "{'Avatar': 'In 2154, humans have depleted Earth\\'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines a valuable mineral Unobtanium on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting Polyphemus, a fictional gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na\\'Vi, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa. It takes 6 years to get from Earth to Pandora in cryogenic sleep.To explore Pandora\\'s biosphere, scientists use Na\\'Vi-human hybrids (grown from human + native DNA) called \"avatars\", operated by genetically matched humans. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Jake was leading a purposeless life on Earth and was contacted by RDA when his brother died. his brother represented a significant investment by RDA, since the avatars are linked to the human DNA/genome. Since Jake is a twin, he has the same exact DNA as his brother and can take his place in the Avatar program.\\nDr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement (as she considers Jake a mere Jarhead) but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard for excursions deep into Na\\'Vi territory.Tracy (Michelle Rodriguez) is the pilot assigned to Grace and her team of Na\\'Vis. While escorting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore), Jake\\'s avatar is attacked by a Thanator (while they were visiting the school that Grace was operating to teach the Omaticaya. She also does test on tree roots and is developing a theory that all living things on the planet are somehow attached and connected to each other) and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na\\'Vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign (Seeds of the sacred tree land on Jake, covering him. Something she later calls Eywa), she takes him to her clan. The Na\\'Vi respect all living things and Neytiri is angry because to save Jake she had to kill many native species. Neytiri\\'s mother Mo\\'At (CCH Pounder), the clan\\'s spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.\\nGrace and Tracy return to base camp, as they are not allowed to run night ops as per protocol. The Omaticaya (the Na\\'Vi clan has its HQ in the Hometree)Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), head of RDA\\'s private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na\\'Vi and the clan\\'s gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree, which stands above the richest deposit of Unobtanium in the area. Jake has 3 months to convince the Na\\'Vi to move as that\\'s when the bulldozers get to the tree. Jake learns that Neytiri and her sister Slywanin studied at Grace\\'s school. Sylwanin is dead.\\nWhen Grace learns of Jake\\'s work for Miles (she sees him explaining the inner structure of the Hometree to Miles and Parker), she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. Neytiri also teaches Jake about Eywa, the network of energy that flows through all living things. Grace also reveals that one day the Omaticaya destroyed a bulldozer and hid inside her school. Miles\\'s troopers attacked them and Sylwanin died. The Na\\'Vi never returned. They wanted Grace to protect the Na\\'Vi.After Jake is initiated into the tribe (he even captures a banshee/Ikran (a flying predator kind of creature), after Neytiri deems him ready to be a warrior. She even takes Jake to the tree of souls, their most sacred site), he and Neytiri choose each other as mates. Jake and Neytiri escape an attack from Toruk, the biggest banshee in the sky. Rider of the Toruk is called Toruk Macto.\\nSoon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na\\'Vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake\\'s attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), and another in which Jake admits that the Na\\'Vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed (this was after the Omaticaya retaliated and destroyed the bulldozers and killed 6 humans in the process. Grace thinks the bulldozers were specifically sent to evoke a response and use that as an excuse for war)Despite Grace\\'s argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na\\'Vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. Jake confesses to the Na\\'Vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch\\'s men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri\\'s father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo\\'At frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch\\'s forces. Pilot Trudy Chac√≥n, disgusted by Quaritch\\'s brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace\\'s outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape. Trudy takes the mobile station and hides it near the tree of souls where Miles cannot find it as the flux vortex scrambles all radars.To regain the Na\\'Vi\\'s trust, Jake attacks and connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na\\'Vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls (the Omaticaya are forced to take him seriously due to the power and symbolism of the Toruk) and pleads with Mo\\'At to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu\\'Tey (Laz Alonso), Jake unites the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a preemptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na\\'Vi.During the subsequent battle, the Na\\'Vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu\\'Tey and Trudy, but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa\\'s answer to Jake\\'s prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake\\'s human body, exposing it to Pandora\\'s poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake\\'s avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time.With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.',\n",
       " 'Django Unchained': 'In 1858, several male slaves are chained and being transported after being purchased by the Speck Brothers, Ace (James Remar) and Dicky (James Russo). Among the slaves is Django (Jamie Foxx), who has been sold away from his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington).\\nSomewhere in Texas, the Speck brothers encounter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist and, unbeknownst to them, a bounty hunter.\\nSchultz halts the procession & asks the group is there is anyone who worked at the Carrucan plantation that was overseen by the 3 Brittle brothers (Big John Brittle ( M. C. Gainey), Roger \"Lil Raj\" Brittle (Cooper Huckabee), and Ellis Brittle (Doc Duhame)). Django replies in the affirmative. The Brittle brothers were overseers at the plantation of Django\\'s previous owner and Schultz has a warrant for their arrests.The Speck brothers refuse to sell their slaves to Schultz. Schultz kills Ace after he points a shotgun at Schultz, and shoots Dicky\\'s horse, crushing his leg under it. Schultz then asks Django if he knows the Brittle Brothers and when he finds out that he does and can identify them, Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for helping him track them down. They leave Dicky to be executed by the slaves as they depart.Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. The two then walk into a saloon despite the fact that Django is forbidden from doing so. When Schultz insists on being served, the barkeep runs out of the saloon to fetch the Sherrif.\\nThe sheriff enters the saloon, shotgun in hand, and tells Schultz and Django to leave. The two comply, and exit out the swinging doors. Schultz is silent, then steps forward. A spring-mounted Derringer pops up in his right hand, and he shoots the sheriff in the stomach. The townspeople are stunned as the sheriff stumbles to the ground, moaning in pain. Schultz walks around the wounded sheriff, aims his Derringer, and shoots him in the head, killing him. The bartender now runs again to fetch the town Marshal.The town marshal and most of the town arrive and train rifles on the front door of the saloon. Schultz hears that he has 100 rifles aimed at his head. Schultz then exits, hands raised over his head, and a paper in his hand. He explains that the dead man who went by the name of \\'Bill Sharpe\\', is a wanted cattle rustler named Willard Peck, with a $200 bounty on his head. Schultz says that the paper in his hand is an official document from a judge that charges King with finding and bringing Peck back to the proper jurisdiction dead or alive. Schultz then suggests that the marshal pay him the $200 fee.Django and Schultz look for the Brittle brothers at Spencer \"Big Daddy\" Bennett\\'s (Don Johnson) Tennessee plantation. Schultz states he is looking to buy one of Bennett\\'s slave girls for an exorbitant price. As he and Bennett talk business, Django is given free range to look around the estate. Django finds that 3 brothers did arrive at the estate in the last year under a different name. Django looks through his telescope and sees that it is Ellis.\\nDjango learns that Big John and Little Raj are on a different part of the plantation, about to whip a young slave girl for breaking eggs. Before the brothers can whip the girl, Django attacks and kills Big John and Little Raj. Ellis rides away on his horse and Scultz shoots him with his sniper rifle. Though Bennett is incensed when he arrives, he is forced to let them go once Schultz explains they are legally authorized to kill and collect these men. Schultz and Django pack up quickly and leave.Bennett pursues them with an armed posse which consists of all the fellow white men of the plantation. The posse surrounds Schultz\\'s cart at night, but Schultz and Django had already anticipated this and were hiding in a nearby tree. Schultz ambushes the posse with explosives in his cart which kills most of them, and Django kills Bennett with a sniper rifle. Schultz realizes that Django is a natural with firearms.Schultz partners with Django in bounty hunting until spring, at which time he will assist Django in tracking down and rescuing Broomhilda. Over the winter, Schultz trains Django in bounty hunting and mastering a sidearm.Django tells Schultz how the Brittle brothers were minding the slaves at the Curracan plantation where he and Broomhilda worked. Curracan (Bruce Dern) wanted to make Broomhilda a comfort girl & hence Django and she tried to run away. They were caught, brought back, branded with hot irons (the mark of a runaway, a small \"R\" on their right cheeks) & sold at an auction separately, even when the owner knew that Django & Broomhilda were married.Django collects his first bounty, a member of a man named Smitty Bacall, and keeps the handbill. Django and King perch themselves on a hill overlooking a small farm where Django hesitates to kill a man who is now peacefully working on the farm and has a son. King explains that before the man owned this farm and started a family, he murdered several people while robbing stagecoaches, and that he has a $7,000 bounty on his head. Hearing this, Django shoots and kills the man in front of his son.After collecting a number of bounties over the winter, Schultz and Django confirm that Broomhilda\\'s current owner is Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the charming but brutal owner of the Candyland plantation in Mississippi, who forces his slaves to fight to the death in \"Mandingo fights\" (slaves fighting each other bare knuckled till death).Schultz expects that Candie will demand an exorbitant price for Broomhilda if they are forthright with their intentions, so they devise a ruse whereby they will pretend to seek the purchase of one of Candie\\'s prize fighters for a hefty sum, meanwhile purchase Broomhilda on-the-side for a more reasonable sum, then disappear before they finalize the bogus deal.\\nSchultz and Django meet Candie at a club in Greenville and offer to buy one of his fighters for $12,000. His greed tickled; Candie invites them to his plantation. On the road, Schultz and Django witness Candie murder one of his Mandingo fighters, who fled due to not wanting to fight any more. Candie\\'s slave trackers had cornered D\\'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh), an escaped Mandingo fighter. Django is forced to intervene when Schultz attempts to buy D\\'Artagnan to save him. Candie has the trackers\\' guard dogs maul D\\'Artagnan to death, visibly upsetting Schultz.At the plantation, Schultz secretly informs Broomhilda of the plot. At dinner, Schultz expresses an incidental interest in Broomhilda because she speaks German and offers $300 for her.Django raises the suspicions of Candie\\'s staunchly loyal senior house slave, Stephen (Samuel L Jackson), who correctly deduces that Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the sale of the Mandingo fighter is a ruse and informs Candie in private. This enrages Candie, who, armed with this information, demands the $12,000 for Broomhilda instead, or he will kill her. Schultz agrees to buy her at this price in order to save her life. After the money is paid and the paperwork signed, Candie demands to shake hands with Schultz to finalize the deal, or Broomhilda will be shot. Schultz, in disgust, shoots and kills Candie point-blank with a concealed Derringer gun. Schultz is shot dead too, and a gun fight erupts.\\nButch Pooch (James Remar), Candie\\'s bodyguard, kills Schultz, and Django kills Pooch, Candie\\'s lawyer Leonide Moguy (Dennis Christopher), and many of Candie\\'s henchmen in a prolonged gunfight. He is forced to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage.The next morning, the chained Django is tortured and about to be castrated by overseer Billy Crash (Walton Goggins) when Stephen arrives.\\nAs punishment, Stephen and Candie\\'s sister Lara (Laura Cayouette) agree to send Django to a mine to be worked to death. Broomhilda, instead of being given her freedom, is locked in a cabin. En route to the mine, Django convinces the slave drivers that he is a bounty hunter, shows them the handbill from his first kill as evidence, and falsely informs them that there is a high-end bounty on some outlaws who have taken refuge back at Candie\\'s plantation. He offers them a cut of the bounty if they free him and ride with him. The moment they free him, he kills the slave drivers, takes their dynamite, and rides back to Candyland.Returning to the plantation, Django discovers Schultz\\'s body. He takes the certificate of freedom that Candie signed for Broomhilda and reunites with her after freeing her from where she was being held. When Candie\\'s mourners return to the Candyland mansion from his funeral, Django reveals himself. He sends off the remaining slaves and in a final shoot-out kills everyone inside except Stephen, whom he shoots in the knees. Having set the dynamite inside the house, he lights the fuse and leaves. Django and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the house explode, killing Stephen, and ride away.',\n",
       " 'Inception': 'Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and business partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are \"extractors\", people who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming. Their latest target is Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe). The extraction from Saito fails when sabotaged by a memory of Cobb\\'s deceased wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). After Cobb\\'s and Arthur\\'s associate sells them out, Saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of \"inception\": planting an idea in a person\\'s subconscious.In order to break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite), Saito wants Cobb to plant the idea of dissolving the company into the mind of Fischer\\'s heir, son Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). Should Cobb succeed, Saito tells Cobb he will use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, which will allow Cobb to return home and to his children. Cobb accepts Saito\\'s offer. Cobb sets about assembling his team: Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and Arthur. Saito insists on accompanying the team to verify the team\\'s success.When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to Los Angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to isolate Fischer. Cobb sedates him, bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors. Using a \"dream within a dream\" strategy, at each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. Due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during the mission will result in entering Limbo, an expanse of infinite raw subconscious. Limbo is a space not dreamed by any one individual but is shared space where one mind can make drastic alterations of any kind.In the first level, Yusuf\\'s rainy downtown dream, the team abducts Fischer; however, Fischer\\'s trained subconscious projections attack, wounding Saito severely. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer\\'s godfather, Peter Browning (Tom Berenger), to suggest Fischer reconsider his father\\'s will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Here, the extractors recruit Fischer, convincing him that his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning and that they are Fischer\\'s subconscious dependency. In the third level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames, Fischer is told they are in Browning\\'s subconscious, but they are really going deeper into Fischer\\'s. Yusuf, under assault in the first level, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of Arthur\\'s dream world and causing an avalanche in Eames\\' dream, a kick which all missed. Arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames\\' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks.Saito succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb\\'s projection of Mal sabotages the entire plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into Limbo. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he spent \"50 years\" with Mal in Limbo constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. Returning to the waking world, Cobb and Mal found less than three hours had passed. Convinced she was still dreaming, Mal committed suicide and tried to persuade Cobb to do so too, by incriminating him in her death. Facing a murder charge Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind, ostensibly in the shared care of his mother- and father-in-law, Prof. Stephen Miles (Michael Caine).Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony, resuscitating him at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his \"own man\", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion. All team members other than Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team\\'s sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf\\'s dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and Robert Fischer have awakened.Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Cobb successfully passes through U.S. customs to his waiting father-in-law, who reunites him with his children. Cobb attempts to determine if he is dreaming or awake by spinning a top but ignores its outcome to instead happily greet his family.',\n",
       " 'Gladiator': 'Shouting \"Roma Invicta!\" as his forces attack, General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) leads the Roman Army to victory against Germanic barbarians in the year 180 A.D., ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Although the dying Aurelius has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding Maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the Roman Senate. Aurelius informs Maximus and offers him time to consider before informing Commodus, who, in a bout of jealousy, murders his father.Declaring himself the emperor, Commodus asks Maximus for his loyalty, which Maximus, realizing Commodus\\' involvement in the Emperor\\'s death, refuses. Commodus orders Maximus\\' execution and dispatches Praetorian Guards to murder Maximus\\' wife and son. Maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family\\'s charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. After burying his wife and son, a grieving Maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves.Slave traders find Maximus and take him to Zucchabar, a rugged province in North Africa, where he is purchased by Proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. Distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, Maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. As he trains and fights further, Maximus befriends Hagen, a Germanic barbarian, and Juba, a Numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving Maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and Maximus\\' eventual reunification with his family.In Rome, Commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father\\'s death, and Proximo\\'s company of gladiators are hired to participate. In a recreation of the Battle of Zama (incorrectly named the Battle of Carthage) at the Colosseum, Maximus leads Proximo\\'s gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. Commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover Maximus as the leader of Proximo\\'s gladiators. The Emperor, unable to kill Maximus because of the crowd\\'s roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena.As the games continue, Commodus pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul, Rome\\'s only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target Maximus. Following an intense battle, Maximus narrowly defeats Tigris and awaits Commodus\\' decision to kill or spare Tigris. As Commodus votes for death, Maximus spares Tigris, deliberately insulting the Emperor and garnering the audience\\'s approval. His bitter enemy now known as \"Maximus the Merciful,\" Commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill Maximus or stop his ascending popularity while Commodus\\' own popularity shrinks.Following the fight, Maximus meets his former servant Cicero, who reveals that Maximus\\'s army remains loyal to him. They are camped at the port Ostia. Maximus forms a plot with Lucilla, Commodus\\' sister, and Senator Gracchus to reunite Maximus with his army and overthrow Commodus. Commodus however, suspecting his sister\\'s betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. Praetorian guards immediately storm Proximo\\'s gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while Maximus escapes. Hagen and Proximo are killed in the siege while Juba and the survivors are imprisoned. Maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness Cicero\\'s death and be ambushed by a legion of Praetorian guards.Concluding that legends born in the Colosseum must die there, Commodus personally challenges Maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. Acknowledging that Maximus\\' skill exceeds his own, Commodus deliberately stabs Maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator\\'s armor. In the arena, the two exchange blows before Maximus rips the sword from Commodus\\'s hands. Commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they betray him and refuse to lend him their weapons. Maximus drops his own sword, but Commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. Maximus then beats Commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto.As Commodus collapses in the now-silent Colosseum, a dying Maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. He reaches for them but is pulled back to reality by the Praetorian prefect Quintus, who asks for instructions. Maximus orders the release of Proximo\\'s gladiators and Senator Gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return Rome to a Senate-based government.Maximus collapses, and Lucilla rushes to his aid. After being reassured that her son is safe and Commodus is dead, Maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. Senator Gracchus and Proximo\\'s gladiators carry his body out of the Colosseum. That night, a newly freed Juba buries Maximus\\' two small statues of his wife and son in the Colosseum, and says that he too will eventually join them, but not yet.',\n",
       " 'Interstellar': 'In the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his family. Humanity needs more farmers to feed the world & the current scientific thinking believes that NASA Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviets (a belief that pisses Cooper off like nothing else). Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), Cooper\\'s 10-year-old daughter, believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. They discover the \"ghost\" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Michael Caine). Dr Brand tells Cooper that every year one crop dies & gets eliminated from the planet forever due to change in climatic conditions & severity of the dust storms. Soon, no crop will ever grow on Earth & the species will starve to death.Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence (& first discovered 48 yrs ago), leads to new planets that may offer hope for survival. NASA\\'s \"Lazarus missions\" have identified three potentially habitable worlds orbiting the black hole Gargantua: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. Originally 12 astronauts were sent to 12 different worlds. Their craft had hibernation capabilities through which the astronauts could live on for decades & wait to be rescued after transmitting habitat data back to Earth. But if the planet was assessed to be uninhabitable, there was no plan for rescue as Earth did not have the resources to again visit all 12 planets. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the astronauts\\' data from the 3 planets; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. But Brand has still not solved the problem of lifting enough of Humanity into space & to the identified planet. So plan B is to population bomb the identified planet with human embryos. The Endurance will carry 5000 human embryos, of which 10 will be incubated & once they grow up, they will be artificially inseminated so as to create a colony of 100s of humans in a few decades.\\nCooper\\'s departure devastates Murphy, and they part on bad terms.On Endurance, Cooper joins Brand\\'s daughter, bio-technologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway) (& Brand\\'s daughter); scientists Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bentley); and robots TARS and CASE. Amelia tells Cooper that Mann was the leader of the expedition that took 12 brave people to uncharted territory. Amelia has great respect for Mann.They enter the wormhole and head to Miller (as the meager data provided by the respective explorers puts Miller\\'s planet as the best option), but discover the planet is so close to Gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on Earth. A team descends to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. As Amelia attempts to recover Miller\\'s data, a wave hits, killing Doyle and delaying the shuttle\\'s departure. When the others return to Endurance, 23 years have passed. Murphy is now grown up & is working with Dr Brand (who is now very old) in solving the gravity equation that is the key to lifting the humanity off Earth in an attempt to recolonize another planet, as per Plan A.On Earth, the adult Murphy (Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with an equation that will enable NASA to launch the space stations via gravity. On his deathbed, Brand admits he already solved the gravity problem and determined that project is impossible as he needed more data from a black hole singularity to completely solve the equation. He concealed his findings to keep hope alive and put his faith in \"Plan B\": using frozen embryos aboard the Endurance to start humanity anew. He also knew that there was no way back to Earth via the wormhole. However, Murphy concludes that Brand\\'s equation could work with additional data from a black hole\\'s singularity.Low on fuel, Endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to Earth. After a tense vote, the team selects Mann\\'s planet, as Mann is still transmitting. Amelia wanted to take Endurance to Edmund\\'s planet as the data showed organic life, but Mann\\'s data was more recent (but showed no organic life). Amelia\\'s theory was that the 3 planets were orbiting a giant black hole & hence all accidents that happened in the universe to create life, simply did not happen in this system, so no asteroids, comets nothing. Her point was that planet showing organic life hence had more promise.However, they discover Mann\\'s planet is icy and inhospitable; Mann (Matt Damon) always knew Plan B was the mission\\'s true goal (he even tells Cooper that Brand knew that he needed a black hole\\'s singularity data before Mann left Earth. And Singularity data is impossible as it hides behind a black hole, through which light itself cannot escape). Romily suggests that the robot TARS can enter the black hole horizon of Gargantuan fast enough & just might survive long enough to transmit data on the singularity. Mann faked data about his planet\\'s viability so Endurance would rescue him. Mann breaks Cooper\\'s spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and flees to Endurance on a shuttle; Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann set to protect his secret. Amelia rescues Cooper on the other shuttle, and they arrive at Endurance in time to witness Mann docking improperly. The airlock explodes, killing Mann and causing serious damage, but Cooper uses the shuttle to get Endurance under control.Nearly out of fuel, Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua on a course toward Edmunds. Due to being directly in the heavy gravity of Gargantua, several more decades actually pass back on Earth while TARS and Cooper detach into the black hole, sacrificing themselves to collect data on the singularity and to propel Amelia by dropping the ship\\'s mass. They emerge in an extra-dimensional \"tesseract\", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murphy\\'s childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realizes the alien beings are future humans who have constructed this space so he can communicate with Murphy and save humanity. Using gravitational waves, Cooper encodes TARS\\'s data on the singularity into the adult Murphy\\'s watch, allowing her to solve Brand\\'s equation and evacuate Earth. Cooper somehow is ejected from the singularity & awakens aboard a NASA space station near Saturn and reunites with the now elderly Murphy (Ellen Burstyn), who has led humanity\\'s exodus. Murphy convinces Cooper to search for Amelia and CASE, who have completed their one-way trip to Edmunds\\' planet, and are setting Plan B into motion.'}"

       "{'Avatar': 'After a decade, Cameron sets the avatar of our new generation I had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron\\'s much anticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar, at the Empire Leicester Square in London.Where to begin! The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking. He did it with the Terminator series and then Titanic, so one would expect Cameron to deliver... and HE DID! The visual are by far some of the sharpest CGI I have seen. You could almost say that there is a disquiet that follows Cameron\\'s soul, as there is no other possibility of this strong and intensified quality. Its production design and visual effects are both noteworthy and it will get its praise upon official release.What it was lacking that really should have shaped the movie is its character/story. I was expecting a complex and believable plot, but was left with a movie with mostly strong visuals. What most sci-fi lovers desire is mind-bending philosophies, fantasy and exploration and limitations of our or outer species. If it was not for this factor, I would give this a 9.5 vote.Avatar will be a success, not only because of Cameron\\'s legacy, but by very intelligent and viral marketing. Avatar have had a powerful marketing technique that assembles other successful blockbusters, such as The Blair Witch project (you all remember it), The Dark Knight (Joker invades the world) and also, the current production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) that is intelligently targeting the market.Kudos to Cameron, Avatar is one of the (if not The) movie of the year. I could get in trouble for sharing this with you guys so early, so please click Yes on \"Was the above comment useful to you?\" as a thank you. ;) Cameron Returns Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na\\'vi. The Na\\'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na\\'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na\\'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron\\'s story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back. A fantastic journey. You know the feeling when you start watching a movie, realizing it\\'s almost 3 hours, and saying to yourself - \"Well this is probably gonna be mostly boring\", well, the creators of this movie didn\\'t let that happen, rest assures.From the beginning up until the ending, every scene is perfected, with amazing acting, stunning directing, great visual effects, and astounding sound effects.The story building is just great , characters are well-developed , and the concept is brilliant.The only thing that\\'s missing to me, is a fitting-soundtrack which could\\'ve give some scenes a great boost.I avoided watching this movie for a long time, because it just seemed a little ridiculous to me (Come on there are blue people) but I\\'m so glad I finally decides to give it a chance, and boy did it serve.Loved it. 9.5/10. AVATAR REVISITED I\\'m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash \\'Avatar\\'. I know it wasn\\'t when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn\\'t get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron\\'s eco-sci-fi extravaganza.Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. \"FernGully in space\" or \"Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people\" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don\\'t get.I mean, it\\'s fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than \\'The Dark Knight\\' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at \\'Avatar\\': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. \"The ideas in the film are not original\", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?So you\\'ve seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You\\'ve seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?You\\'ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many \"eco-sci-fi\" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (\"the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy\"; \"the soldier who realizes he\\'s been fighting for the wrong cause\"; \"the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he\\'s invading\" or the timeless trope of \"the fish out of water\"), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from \\'Dances With Wolves\\' either - any more than that film stole them from \\'Pocahontas\\': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from \\'Lawrence of Arabia\\' to \\'Shogun\\' or \\'The Last Samurai\\' and countless others.And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film\\'s most vicious detractors claim), but that\\'s because they aren\\'t really the film\\'s main focus. \\'Avatar\\'s actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It\\'s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake\\'s eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).More than anything, \\'Avatar\\' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It\\'s a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of \"Home Tree\" does in Cameron\\'s film.So again (I\\'m trying to hammer my point home here ;-), \\'Avatar\\' is simple? Yes, but that\\'s the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they\\'re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that\\'s exactly what Cameron\\'s intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film\\'s success, it obviously did.Personally, I think \\'Avatar\\' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, \\'Avatar\\' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It\\'s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.Obviously that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it\\'s fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but \\'Avatar\\' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn\\'t equal simplistic, and the fact that \\'Avatar\\' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn\\'t make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I\\'m concerned, that\\'s exactly what \\'Avatar\\' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over. It\\'s an experience! A magical one. I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It\\'s beyond belief how a film like this could\\'ve been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I\\'m from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I\\'m definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art! Best movie experience of the last 30 years... I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.Well, let me tell you: they went to this movie with the wrong expectations.You have most likely met Cameron\\'s previous work(s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!), just to name a few.So WHAT should you expect from Avatar??? MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn\\'t give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na\\'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of \"yessss... now THAT makes sense.\"Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that. Fascinating concept .Must be seen cannot be described I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a \\'Must see\\' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it\\'s excitement and holds the audience\\'s attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Visually stunning, but ultimately unimaginative First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie.Let\\'s start with the picture. As I said before, the special effects and computer animation are really good; the textures feel very real, and the degrees of liberty that CGI animation allows in terms of camera angles and movement is well used for dramatic effects. The luxurious vegetation of the forest and the CGI-animated wild animals are a treat to the eyes. In terms of artwork, there is a definite influence from Nausicaa (the forest-world, the spores) and Starcraft (the vessels, the goliaths). I saw the movie in an IMAX movie with 3D glasses, but I am not convinced that they used the full potential of it - quite honestly, the Haribo commercial before the movie made a better use of it. I find it more strenuous to watch a movie with the 3D-glasses - some details are blurry, and it feels likewise when the camera makes swift lateral movements.Now, the scenario - the movie disappoints in that area. The plot is very Manichean, and it feels like a remake of Pocahontas, interspersed with elements from / tributes to Star Wars (Pandora and the Na\\'vi look like Endor and the Ewoks respectively), Nausicaa (the forest as an entity, the destructive impact of civilization on nature, the spores in the forest), Starcraft (Colonel Quarritch and Dr Augustine bear some resemblance with Arcturus Mensk and Sarah Kerrigan), Matrix (the concept of controlling another image of self), and maybe even Independence Day (the pilot fighter suicide) and the Lion King (the father\\'s death, \"go, and never come back!\", ... am I going to far here?). But I can honestly say that I haven\\'t been surprised at any point in the movie. You know from the beginning that he will be accepted by the Na\\'vi, that he will fall in love, that he will defect, that he will ultimately prevail after suffering some heavy casualties, and that he will find a way to permanently transfer his mind into the body of his avatar.It would have been interesting if the movie had dealt in more depth with the issues related to transferring one\\'s mind into another body for instance, maybe a la Twelve Monkeys Army, where the \"hero\" is clearly deeply affected by experiences that the mind is not used to deal with (time travel in that case, but it is not that different from what we have here). Likewise, the love interest of our hero seems very indifferent to the fact that he really is a human remotely controlling a human - Na\\'vi bastard. I was expecting someone (him, her, or even one of the other humans in the scientific group) to show at least some kind of surprise / doubt when these feelings emerge. I was expecting more complexity in the social interactions of the characters, and their personality.I also take issues with some big stereotypes: corporations and the white men are greedy, indigenous people are pure, brave, and connected to the earth, but dumb - thankfully there is a human to teach them how to fight those who come from the sky. To some extent, the movie feels like a remake of the colonization of the Americas; just replace the Na\\'vis by native Americans, the aircrafts by ships, and modern weapons by muskets, and you have it. Except of course the colonization of the Americas did not have such a happy ending for the native tribes.On the whole, the movie is beautiful, but it feels like the main goal was to showcase fancy special effects. The movie would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less linear and predictable plot. My rating is 6/10. A great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker! Twelve years later, Titanic creator James Cameron yet again delivers a great science fiction extravaganza with the usual tropes and clich√©s of a \"good guy\" who must overcome a battle with his own morals to do what\\'s right, but somehow making it all work beautifully. The characters, the musical score for every scene, the beauty and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, living forests, thundering waterfalls, nimble beasts, flying dragon-birds, and the way cultures of the Na\\'vis is portrayed will truly keep you captivated and leave you beyond impressed.In its initial release, Avatar garnered mass positive reviews and went on to break multiple box office records in various markets. Worldwide, it became the highest-grossing movie of all time and bagged multiple awards in its genre including The Oscars. The story follows a paraplegic Marine who replaces his deceased twin brother to the distant moon Pandora on a unique mission but soon finds himself struggling between following orders and protecting a world he feels is his home. His aim; to persuade the mystic, nature-loving Na\\'vis to clear way for humans to mine their home and obtain a valuable mineral unobtainium; however, things take a turn when he falls in love with the Na\\'vi princess, Neytiri, and is eventually drawn into a battle with his own race for the survival of her world. As the planet\\'s environment is poisonous, human/Na\\'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora which is one if not the main focus of the film. With science fiction, the film also displays a series of unexplained phenomena that could not otherwise be explained by logic but relates to a more spiritual and imaginary level keeping in sync with the entire mystical setting of the storyline. The action sequences look phenomenal and you can definitely feel the scale of the two races fighting each other through Cameron\\'s direction.While the majority agree that \"Avatar\" uses its sci-fi plot as a metaphor to give voice to our fears of the future and setting a great example of showing how we will fail in our efforts to eventually create a world full of destruction, some argue that it supports racist theme of a white hero yet again saving the primitive natives. The film also has connotations pointing to mass genocide, to the conflicts in countries like Iran and Vietnam, and to ecological situations like deforestation. However, I believe to view it from the perspective of a film that pits greedy, immoral humans against noble inhabitants and follows a message that all living is connected, and those who intend to exploit nature rather than respect it will only destroy themselves. This becomes evident when all the animals hostile to Pandora come together to charge at the humans to defend their land and their existence. The Ikran (flying birds) attack the aircrafts while the forest animals fight the soldiers on the ground. Neytiri can be heard yelling \"Jake, Eywa heard you!\" insinuating that mother nature recognized the importance of defending itself.After its release, Avatar became an extremely controversial movie, with some people claiming it to be groundbreaking while others calling it an overlong and derivative bore. The warranted hate, in my opinion, comes from the fact that it\\'s got a few blatant similarities to other movies that stress on the overproduced heroic factor, however, it is evident that Cameron has poured his heart and soul into this masterpiece, breaking through the motion-capture tech frontier with state of the art CGI. So even if the movie doesn\\'t exactly consist of the biggest twists and turns, it surely sets out to stun us with the enchanting VFX that made the whole mystical world convincing and life-like, working in favor of a classic, albeit overused, storyline.In conclusion, Avatar is about a race of humanoids that could not be more alien from us, and yet, by about half way through the film, it manages to completely convince us of their realism, their plight and their humanity. It also demonstrated in harsh terms our audacity to be merciless and barbaric to those who appear different from us. This movie did what it set out to do perfectly and maybe even better, and towards the end, it will get you wondering about all the possibilities of life existing in the depths of the universe out there. Without much exaggeration, it is a cinematic experience of the generation, ahead of its time, that will leave you spellbound in the best way possible. So if you haven\\'t seen Avatar, then you should see it as soon as possible- a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker! How could anyone who\\'s seen more than 4 movies in their life find this creative? Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think \"Terminator\" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, \"Aliens\" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. \"Abyss\" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, \"Terminator 2\" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, \"True Lies\" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally \"Titanic\" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.So then there was the 12 year wait for \"Avatar\". No reviews, word of mouth, ticket price or natural disaster would keep me from the midnight IMAX 3D screening. I went with moderate expectations, which the film matched exactly. While this kept me from being disappointed it wasn\\'t a good thing.Movie fans were on edge because if \"Avatar\" flops, it\\'ll mean the death of creativity in a remake-happy Hollywood. That\\'s a valid concern but the problem is nothing in \"Avatar\" is creative whatsoever. It is literally \"Dances with Wolves\" in space, right down to having a \"Wind in his Hair\" character as a foil to the \"new guy\".As the movie progressed it caused the worst of all bad reactions for me as a viewer - I started thinking about other things. Then I kept thinking \"well the end battle is supposed to be awesome\".SPOILER WARNING! (if for some reason you can\\'t guess how this movie ends) End battle comes and the movie switches from being \"Dances with Wolves\" to Disney\\'s \"Atlantis\" (but that\\'s unfair since both of those movies contained far, FAR better musical scores) Gunship windows that were impervious to arrows a few scenes ago (to show Na\\'vi desperation) suddenly become brittle and break easily (to show Na\\'vi heroism). The battle isn\\'t nearly as long as you\\'d expect, and nowhere near as epic / engaging as the finale of Return of the King. Finally there\\'s a Robo-suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. Unlike 95% of directors these days Cameron knows enough to pull the camera back and let us SEE the fight. However it\\'s an odd choice to spend millions on 10 foot tall \"creatures\" and then rarely even have them in the same frame as humans.And of course there\\'s the obligatory scene where characters are dying in slow motion as Middle Eastern vocal music plays (see Gladiator or Munich) Wouldn\\'t have been so bad if I hadn\\'t said to my friend on the way there \"How much you wanna bet there\\'s a part where characters die in slow motion over Middle Eastern music?\"As with most movies these days \"Avatar\" is far too long, glossing over important details (why is Earth dying, what does Unobtainium do, etc) and instead spending time on flight scenes, mystic ceremonies, spirit trees and nature bonding.Ultimately I just did not care. Since the dawn of cinema Hollywood recycles old ideas every few decades and slaps on a bigger budget / new stars / better effects so you won\\'t notice. I can see re-doing \"Ben Hur\" with color and sound, but why do we need \"Dances with Wolves\" with 20 times the budget and blue Native Americans? No amount of impressive visuals, robo-suits, gunship battles, perfect character CGI or Sigorney Weaver can change the fact that I\\'ve seen this movie 100 times before. I could even accept the weak story if there were any characters to give a rat\\'s ass about. This film is also dreadfully humorless, a stark contrast to \"Titanic\" where humor was one of its many surprises.Regarding 3D... I\\'ve seen many films in it now and honestly you don\\'t even notice after the few minutes. It doesn\\'t make the money any better or worse, just more expensive.Citizen Kane, The Robe, Sound of Music, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Toy Story, The Matrix... these movies changed movies. We can say that looking back now. \"Avatar\" saying it would ahead of time is pure hubris, \"unsinkable Titanic\"-like poppycock.But if expensive motion-capture being used to cover up a weak, generic story is the future of cinema then count me out, I\\'ll stick with my PS3. One of the best cinematic experiences ever... Forgive me, I\\'m going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven\\'t had the jitters after a film the way I\\'ve had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron\\'s Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler\\'s List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na\\' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na\\' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who\\'s on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na\\' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it\\'s sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner\\'s score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron\\'s exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He\\'s a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics\\' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997\\'s Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don\\'t work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you\\'ll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***¬Ω/**** Visually mind-blowing, but lacking in the story I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn\\'t know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar\\'s strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar\\'s strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron\\'s direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn\\'t help really her character isn\\'t that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren\\'t given very much to do.What didn\\'t work so well is that Avatar\\'s story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don\\'t get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn\\'t exactly original, as I often heard it described as \"Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully\"- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clich√©d, especially Giovanni Ribisi\\'s, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox Technically outstanding. Originality: oh well.... Well, I just saw Avatar this morning, one of the press premieres which are running on these days. My opinion: you\\'ve seen this story a hundred times, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it\\'s supposed to be, an instrument at the service of the movie. You\\'ll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.As for the story, some of the \"inspirations\" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I\\'m not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you\\'re 15 or so, you\\'ll have a great time thinking that it\\'s the first time somebody makes something like this. If you\\'re an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clich√©s.I liked it, however: \"the movie that re-invents movies\"??? No way. Incredible scope and spectacle A film with the scope of James Cameron\\'s Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today\\'s economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na\\'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That\\'s not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clich√©d and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clich√©d despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10 The best blockbuster in years - the master is back! It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991\\'s Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn\\'t count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity ‚Äì a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake\\'s (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience ‚Äì not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D ‚Äì which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG ‚Äì something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek\\'s Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na\\'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back! A NEW WORLD..... Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I\\'ve never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That\\'s why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don\\'t miss this one on the big screen if you haven\\'t seen it. It\\'s a total new world experience. Can\\'t wait for the PART 2.... Visually Spellbinding! I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local \"Event Cinema\" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi\\'s faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since \"The Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2\" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!5/5 Looks great, I just wish I cared what happened in it \"Avatar\" is not the next \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings.\" It might be the next \"Matrix,\" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next \"Matrix Revolutions.\" It\\'s technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after \"Return of the King.\" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they\\'re all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film\\'s story.It\\'s the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the \"Na\\'vi,\" aren\\'t too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na\\'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na\\'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he\\'s paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don\\'t feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what\\'ll happen. You\\'ve seen \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" Heck, even \"Dead Man.\" The Na\\'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, \"we have to fight terror with terror.\" The Na\\'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It\\'s all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it\\'s entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson\\'s King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It\\'s worth seeing for that reason, but I don\\'t think it\\'ll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about \"Star Wars\" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don\\'t think anyone will remember \"Jake Sully.\" 6/10 Avatar - Breathtakingly Beautiful When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it\\'s industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it\\'s audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it\\'s an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90\\'s, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na\\'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the \"Avatar Program\", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na\\'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot\\'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70\\'s, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40\\'s - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it\\'s time.4 Stars out of 4 Stars Visually amazing, but otherwise average at best Yeah this movie took several steps forward in terms of cinematography and filming technology, but that is all that can really be said to be what makes this film worth seeing. Everything else that makes a film great is totally lack luster.There is no deep character development. Why does Jake Sully really want to become a part of the Navi? What was life on Earth like? What really makes him want to break away from his roots there? Is it just the ability to walk? I mean are there no more Native Americans or Buddhists left on Earth (which is clearly who the Navi were based off of) to give him that spiritual satisfaction? How does he feel about filling his brother\\'s shoes? Twin relationship? The conflict between scientists and the military is not developed. Every supporting character was a stock character. Michelle Rodriguez somehow manages to have a place in Hollywood after literally playing the same type of character in every film she is in (Fast and the Furious, SWAT, Blue Crush...yeah just put her in a futuristic helicopter and thats her in this one). Was Sigourney Weaver supposed to be a mother figure? How did the bad guy from the Last of the Mohicans feel about faking a Native American language? The plot was totally predictable, and the dialogue was crap. It was like James Cameron turned in his dialogue assignment a day late.This movie deserves no award nominations at all outside of those in technical categories. Escapism at it\\'s best Just go! The people who made this movie, most of which are just average working people making a normal salary deserve it for what they have created. This movie accomplishes what most people go to movies for. To escape from reality for a little while.Not only is this what I consider a milestone in the evolution of state of the art movie making, it\\'s a good story with a simple message.A bit annoyed at some of the criticisms. I don\\'t see anything political in the metaphorical message this movie presents. If Republicans hate the idea that getting close to nature is good and war is bad then too bad so sad for them! There is only 1 directly political reference to Bush. That is when the military offensive is referred to as a \"shock and awe\" campaign. If people are going to get their panties in a bunch over that then again, sucks to be them! Also don\\'t understand the criticisms about the similarity to Dances with Wolves. Dances with Wolves was not a unique idea. Modern society has been screwing over aboriginals for centuries. What is so bad in pointing that out once in awhile in a way that most people can relate to? By seeing it through the eyes of someone from this modern world.I loved every minute of this movie. There were a couple tiny teeny little things in the dialog I would have done differently but no matter how you slice it, this is a masterpiece! This movie made me feel blue I realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment, and you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, I\\'m entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That\\'s right, it\\'s crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question: If it didn\\'t have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it\\'s a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It\\'s a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that Star Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don\\'t know... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I\\'ll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That\\'s it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there\\'s that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn\\'t belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense. Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me ‚Äì particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first \"big\" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na\\'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally ‚Äì it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I\\'m seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn\\'t quite hit the same mark for me. The \"look it\\'s in 3D\" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn\\'t aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great ‚Äì the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about \"how did they do that shot\" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious ‚Äì others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I\\'ll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as \"Unobtainium\" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn\\'t ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana\\'s performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is \"so-so\", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clich√©d that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn\\'t add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these. Avatar: Once in a lifetime film making James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. He is what you may call an Auteur. If you aren\\'t aware of this, then you probably are not a movie person. James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic. That last one I\\'m not a fan of, but he won Best Director, Picture, and it became the highest grossing film of all time. $1.2 billion dollars.Avatar is his latest film, it is a movie that has been in the works since 1994. After a decade of being in the works, you would expect it to be a good movie. But the real question is it any good? It is the most expensive film ever made. The budget was $500,000,000 so you\\'ll be wondering if all that money was put to good use, and if you should spend $11.00 to see the film in 3-D. Should you or should you not?The answer is that you should. Avatar is a monumental success. It is a film unlike anything you have ever seen. It uses special effects to a level that you have never seen, and that\\'s not a bad thing.The story to Avatar revolves around Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who is sent unwillingly to a hostile planet known as Pandora. While on this planet he finds himself caught in the middle of a war between the planet\\'s indigenous people known as the Na\\'vi, and his own race. He must decide whether he should fight for what he knows is right or help his own people destroy Pandora as they destroyed earth. I don\\'t want to spoil anything in the story, so I\\'ll refrain from saying anything else. To put it simple, the whole movie was the prime example of a colonialism work.The cast in Avatar is strong. Sam Worthington (Terminator: Salvation) stars as Jake Sully. He does a fantastic job, but the real credit in the film has to go to Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) for playing the native Neytiri. She creates most of the emotion in the entire film. She preforms fantastically and I also have to mention that she is also really attractive as a blue woman. (True fact.) Some people have complained about Stephen Lang (Public Enemies) as the antagonist of the film. But he actually pulls off a very believable and cruel performance. All the actors in the film are great. But the real actors are the ones that are the digital Na\\'vi. These actors are the ones that create the film. I think that this movie is proof that special effects don\\'t have to be of just robots killing and blowing stuff up. (Even though that\\'s in this movie.) This movie shows that special effects can be used to take us to places that we never even dreamed of.Other films have used special effects like this. (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean, District 9) But none of them have gone as far as this movie has. This movie takes you to a whole new level of film making that you can\\'t even imagine. You almost want to call this movie insane, because of how different and unique it is. You really have never seen anything like this, and that\\'s a very good thing. What I really enjoyed about this film, was how it is a breath of fresh air. You don\\'t see that very often. The only other films to do that this year for me were District 9 and Fantastic Mr. Fox. But Avatar is far more different and unique than these other movies.One thing that I always enjoy about a James Cameron film is his sense of innovation. Avatar is the most innovative movie I\\'ve seen in years. It is so different from anything else that you have seen. It is a movie a film that you literally cannot describe. This is a see to believe film. You\\'ll have to see the movie to believe that it\\'s as good as I\\'m telling you. Avatar is a once in a lifetime film. You will not get another chance to see a movie like this one.James Cameron creates not only a visually beautiful race of people, but also a culture that is so beautiful. The Na\\'vi in Avatar felt very Native American to me. Everything from how they dress to the musical score is very unique, and made me think of Native Americans. The film was almost like a reenactment of our history, with the Native Americans being driven out of their home land. It\\'s all very believable. It\\'s all very sad as well; and it moves you. I sympathize with the Na\\'vi as they fight for their lives and their home.I am not a fan of 3D. I think it is over used, and ultimately lessens the movie experience. Avatar however, is not like that. The 3D in Avatar is extraordinary. Little bugs on the screen fly right past you, leaves fall from trees towards you, and the battles are astronomical. You really feel like you\\'re there, and forget that this is a movie. The cinematography is actually enhanced by the 3D which is a rare thing. The wide flying camera shots make you feel like you\\'re flying with the film, it is fantastic.Avatar is a difficult movie to review because it is so innovative. It blows away almost all sci-fi epics out there, and is a must see. See Avatar. It is well worth full-price, and it is the best picture of the year. The only movie that comes to being as good as Avatar is District 9. Avatar however, I will say is better because Avatar has heart. A truly fantastic movie. Avatar is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, it is James Cameron\\'s masterpiece, and it should not be missed. Masterpiece for eye and soul... This movie actually blew my mind! I have to admit that it\\'s quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed by the feelings this film left. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think. The Sorrounding on \"Pandora\" doesn\\'t let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. This is no \"switch off your brain\"-movie!!!In my opinion this film is worth 9-10 stars, I\\'m giving 10 for the goose-flesh it still gives me every time I see the trailer or hear the soundtrack. This evening I\\'m gonna watch it again :-)PS: Sorry for my bad English, I\\'m from Germany... ',\n",
       " 'Django Unchained': 'Great film with the crazy passion of a great director Great direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, cinematography, costume design, production design, all the things you can expect from a Tarantino film.Also like others Tarantino films, only those who really have a extensive knowledge of films are going to really appreciate some things, like the Franco Nero scene. Unmistakable Tarantino Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django\\'s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It\\'s the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it\\'s the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it\\'s still a great film. The Perfect Movie For anyone who isn\\'t much into cinema, I would recommend watching Django Unchained and you will fall in love with films forever.This film is a classic western full of drama, suspense and tension with a tremendously unpredictable plot but with a sense of realism taken into consideration.I believe it would be hard to dislike this masterpiece as it has it all: action, adventure and even a sense of romance and the occasional humour. Tarantino is undefeated This is a movie that wouldn\\'t work with every other director other than Tarantino. Just like all of his movies, film making top tier. Every aspect of this film is amazing My favourite Tarantino, and that\\'s a bold statement. A German bounty hunter flees a Slave, Django, and the pair embark on a mission to find Django\\'s wife.As soon as I heard Luis Bacalov\\'s Django, I was hooked.This remains my favourite Tarantino film, and let\\'s be fair there are many classics in that particular catalogue.Django is equal parts shocking, entertaining, dramatic, bold, funny and original, to this day no other film exists that is remotely similar. It\\'s a western, action packed love story, it really is a one off.Three hours passed by effortlessly, it\\'s one of those films where I wasn\\'t aware of time passing by, I was engrossed and absorbed into it.Some of the humour is hilarious, and in the context of the film works to perfection, the humour is as good, as the violence and misery of slavery are guy wrenching.The music is absolutely wonderful, the perfect soundtrack accompanies this great film. Indeed the whole production is exemplary, it\\'s a skilfully crafted film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it\\'s very skillfully put together, with costumes, sets and lighting all on point, with the unbelievable staging as well.Now I am sometimes quick to highlight who stands out in a film or TV series, but how can you do that here, every single performance is on point, Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, I honestly don\\'t think it gets better than this assembly of greats.It\\'s no wonder it gave us so many memes, who hasn\\'t seen this masterpiece. If you haven\\'t grab your remote, and improve your day.10/10. Best Tarantino movie and you can\\'t change my mind Jango (D is silence) is just one of those movie you can watch every year and it never gets old.It\\'s also the origin of those Di Caprio memes you saw online, so you know is good.Also Christoph Waltz stole the show here and made me discover all other his movies. Tarantino at his best (Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he\\'s heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn\\'t feel that way as the film is so action packed that it\\'ll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I\\'ll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece. a brilliant film Tarantino is unpredictable. You never know what to expect in the next scene. And that\\'s make the movie interesting. The music is also excellent. Only this blood is too much for me. So I give 8. Great Mix Of Action And Comedy Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic directors of the 21st (and late 20th) century, why? Simple. Because of masterpieces like this. Tarantino defies the laws of film, he shoots them in his own way, however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However, Django Unchained is Tarantino\\'s first look at the Western genre, his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his \"deputy\" during their tasks of bounty hunting, in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django\\'s lost wife, Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances, particularly Christoph Waltz (also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa). Both Foxx and DiCaprio\\'s performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some light-hearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn\\'t stay too serious, as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There\\'s a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars. A masterpiece! Django Unchained is a 2012 Hollywood movie depicting the story of a former slave turned freeman who just wants to get his wife back. He will stop at nothing to unite with his wife.A brilliant masterpiece of a movie. The gut-wrenching way in which slavery in past-America is depicted is simply awe-inspiring. Quentin Tarantino goes all out to show the viewers what slavery was like in those days.Every character in the movie were aptly cast and put on a splendid show. Every scene with Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz is memorable and impressionable.All in all, this is a Tarantino movie. So, you gotta watch it. A revenge story so good that it will stir up your insides! Revenge. I enjoyed this action/comedy movie because I hated the evil doers and wanted to see them die because of their brutal natures. I reveled in their pain. And that\\'s the problem.I\\'m going along about half way on this one because the performances are as good as they are and I can appreciate Quentin Tarantino\\'s collegial sense of humor. Two \"Django\\'s\" shaking hands. Brunhilde and Siegfried coming out of nowhere. A musical score that is an homage to Ennio Morricone. The surprises that pop out of a man\\'s mouth or his sleeve.Tarantino\\'s earlier stuff was pretty good -- \"Reservoir Dogs\", \"Pulp Fiction\" -- and \"Jackie Brown\" was finely written and directed, a very nice piece of work. The \"Kill Bills\" was far too stylized for me.\"Inglourious Basterds\" was a disappointment. It was much more violent than anything else he\\'s done, and instead of comic internal conflicts, he\\'d chosen as villains the Nazis, the most evil people of the century, and their torture and murder could be endorsed without chagrin by the least sophisticated of us, the kind who think \"Don\\'t just kill the enemy; torture them before killing them.\" It was a kind of pornography for the millions.He\\'s followed the same course here and I didn\\'t like it much. Given the depraved character of the slave-owning Southerners, no punishment is too harsh, so Django can kill helpless and unarmed people -- including women -- at will. As a hero, the character of Django is not just flawed but practically turned inside out. Superman was a hero Roy Rogers was a hero. Django was a walking abattoir, savagely killing everyone he disliked -- and Tarantino has provided him with a the simple-minded excuse of hating that \"peculiar institution.\" I don\\'t want him as my hero. He\\'s too Old Testament for me.The performances are good, though, and the production values high. Jamie Foxx has about two notes on his instrument but Christoph Waltz does a great job as the German bounty hunter. His accent doesn\\'t sound German at all. It sounds like it came from somewhere in outer space. And Don Johnson is surprisingly chipper and colorful as Big Daddy, the plantation owner who gets splashily offed by Django\\'s powerful rifle. (The squibbs seem to have had double charges.) Tarantino obviously has a lot of talent and a keen sense of humor. I wish he\\'d get back to his roots and lay off the easy targets. Very Disappointing I saw Django Unchained with the expectation of any Tarantino fan. But I left shaking my head in disappointment. This is not a bad film, but I\\'m not saying it\\'s a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly, it\\'s the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz, first of all, is in similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role, but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script, I never really invested in him. It\\'s as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that\\'s what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a scene where he gets the evil monologue, but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character. Jamie Foxx, first of all, was the right choice for Django, but I believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long while to get invested in him, but at that point, why bother? BUT, the standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority, when it comes to disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye, how it\\'s a great revenge tale, how the characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good Quentin Tarantino film. The film is too long, with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. Maybe it\\'s the love of Quentin that will jade people. I know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film, Django falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of character(s) and story in a hyper active world. It loses it\\'s identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films. A Bountiful Tale... Django\\'s luck, has taken quite a turn, the chains around his legs, have suddenly been spurned, Dr Schultz did him a favour, uncoupled him from viscous slavers, now they\\'re off to see what bounties can be earned. The rewards are more enticing than plain cash, as they hunt down evil villains and watch them crash, their revolvers take them out, seldom having time to shout, it\\'s akin to picking up, discarded trash. Now Django\\'s keen to find his wife who\\'s kept, by Calvin Candie who is cunningly adept, at keeping people tethered, disobey and they get leathered, but the duo plan to make an intercept.Great performances, great dialogue and a bountiful tale set during the less celebratory times of a countries history. \"D-J-A-N-G-O.... the \\'D\\' is silent.\" After all the hype, all the articles and reviews, after all the controversy over the \\'n\\' word, after all is said and done, Tarantino kicks butt again and comes up with a terrifically entertaining movie. Notice I said entertaining and not necessarily enjoyable. There are a number of scenes that are clearly not enjoyable, in fact, downright troubling like the dog attack of the black slave D\\'Artagnan (Ato Essandoh) and the hot box scene involving Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). But over all, Tarantino has fashioned a well told revenge tale modeled on the Spaghetti Western genre of the Seventies. And it begins immediately with a classy credit for the \\'friendly participation of Franco Nero\\', the original coffin dragging gunslinger from the 1966 film who\\'s name is resurrected here because frankly, it just sounds really cool.Now here\\'s the problem I have with folks who find racism around every corner - when a movie depicts events or themes that have racism at it\\'s core, it doesn\\'t mean that the picture or the film maker is racist or is making a racist statement. The entire controversy in the media surrounding the use of the \\'n\\' word here is a prime example of critiquing the movie as a racist film. Personally, whenever I heard it used in the picture, it sounded to me like part of the era\\'s vernacular and not as a pretext for sensationalism. So here\\'s a question I have for the critics - when will you put Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson on the spot for their participation in the project? Are they being racist, or are they artists? Or is it only Quentin who has to answer for the film\\'s language and subject matter? What I didn\\'t expect from the movie was the amount of humor and comedic dialog that came along with it. The bag head scene was surreally comic and just mind blowingly funny, but you really have to listen to the dialog to get it. The guy who was upset over the critique of his wife\\'s working on the hoods was something one could easily relate to, and yet it sounded completely ludicrous even in context. I guess you have to be a little warped to come up with something like that, but warped seems to be right up Tarantino\\'s alley. He proves it once and for all when he has Django blow himself sky high with the bag of dynamite. Priceless.As for the violence, well it\\'s red meat bloody and about as visceral as it gets, so if you\\'re on the squeamish side, there are a few scenes that may give you the heaves. It\\'s one area where the director explicitly goes over the top and much of it is quite unbelievable. I have to admit though, the \\'say goodbye\\' scene with Miss Lara Lee (Laura Cayouette) was the best, and it wasn\\'t bloody at all. That was one of the times the picture entered \\'Kill Bill\\' territory.As for a recommendation, you\\'ll just have to guage your own preferences. I\\'m a Western movie and Tarantino fan and there was no way I was going to miss this. Casual movie goers with a low tolerance for gore and gratuitous shoot \\'em up scenes should most likely stay away. Finally, for those hung up about the media\\'s fascination with the \\'n\\' word, I tried keeping up with the count as the picture progressed. I\\'ve read accounts that placed the number at well over a hundred, but I came up with seventy seven myself, realizing that I probably missed a few because it\\'s easy to have your attention diverted by other elements in the story. No reason we can\\'t get a recount with captioning on the DVD when it comes out. Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino\\'s latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino ‚Äì he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django\\'s editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino\\'s work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he\\'s ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object ‚Äì but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie\\'s adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django\\'s shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10. It\\'s not perfect but it\\'s very good... and I\\'m not even a fan of Tarantino! I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino\\'s style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn\\'t feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino\\'s exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don\\'t like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club\\'s black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in \"Inglorious Bastards\" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director\\'s brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from \"Django\" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre. Tarantino-gasm! Merry Christmas to all you Tarantino fans out there. I hope you made a Tarantino checklist so here we go.Witty dialogue, check. Excessive profanity especially use the word \\'nigger\\', check. Excessive violence including testicles getting blown off, check. Soulful musical score, check. Sometimes non-linear narrative, check. Shots of women\\'s feet, check. Very great character driven plot, check. An actual spaghetti western, even though it takes place in the American South, check.There are four standout characters played by the top billed actors.Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter. Even though he is the titular character, he gets downplayed when in the presence of the other actors. Still he delivers a solid performance, in fact hes very convincing. We all know Jamie Foxx as this golden voice RnB singer and comedian with a very clean cut image. He was able to pull off the whole transitioning from a timid slave to a menacing bounty hunter. Not only that he had the whole look down too, with all the facial scarring and the messy hair.Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schulz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter who frees Django so he could help pursue his previous owners who are targets. Waltz is a very charismatic actor, and thats how he does this role. Presents every line with finesse.Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet. He plays a plantation owner, Calvin Candie, and is the owner of Django\\'s wife. This is a very different role. We\\'ve seen Leonardo in gritty roles before but never did he play this lecherous antagonist. We were all used to Leo being this teen idol, who looked like a member of Hanson. Here he\\'s this Southerner with discoloured teeth and a scruffy beard.Finally Samuel L. Jackson who plays Steve, a house slave who you could say is the secret antagonist here. For all the screen time that he has he dominates. Sam usually plays boisterous roles as a tough guy, but it was very interesting seeing him play a devious and manipulative old man.The only gripe here was that this film was a little too long exceeding the three act structure, but its an epic western film so I\\'ll excuse Tarantino for that. Yet again he made another great film with a lot of flair and carried well by the four big hitter actors. Well done Mr. Tarantino. Absolutely love this movie. Probably the best Tarantino film in my opinion. But let\\'s be fair, it\\'s really close. Regardless, Django represents everything I appreciate about this director. Drama, comedy, amazing dialogue, extreme violence, etc. I named my dog after this masterpiece, so remember the D is silent! A Little Too Much Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It\\'s a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson\\'s house slave is almost as good as Washington\\'s performance. He\\'s an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can\\'t even imagine existed. He\\'s the darker twin of Scarlet\\'s mammy in \"GWTW\", way darker and just as fascinating. There\\'s of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can\\'t comprehend what\\'s going on in his world, but who doesn\\'t stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.\"Django\" is a hybrid of Westerns? and a very strange take on slavery, looking at it through Tarantino\\'s special lens. He\\'s unable to edit himself, and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through Django and Schultz quest to rescue their \"lost princess\", I kept wondering why he overindulges all the time. Things don\\'t clash here, they explode with such magnitude that I was wondering why wasn\\'t 3-D involved in the process. I kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the NC-17 rating.There is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language, and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film, but when there is confrontation, you almost feel like ducking or you\\'ll be hit by some of the flying organs. Much of the praise here should go to the way the Old West comes alive with the costumes and art direction. There is also the amazing job Robert Richardson does with his camera, making the film look and feel like one of those Spaghetti Westerns he\\'s paying tribute to. I loved the way he brings in Franco (the original Django) and interacts with this movie\\'s hero. There\\'s of course, some Ennio Morricone, and a few other touches that show Tarantino\\'s adoration of the genre.Is there a story? Well, barely. A lot of the film is about the feel of it, like getting on a ride without expecting much depth, and to be fair, there shouldn\\'t be a IQ test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment, but I think Spielberg knew how to control himself in \"Saving Private Ryan\" by limiting the massacres to the first 20 minutes. A little restraint would have helped here. Who knows? Tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece.Another detail that is puzzling me. We\\'re hearing all this praise for the movie, like it\\'s the second coming of Peckinpah or the latest collaboration between Benton, Penn, and Carpenter. It\\'s as much fun as the best \\'60\\'s B movie, but I am not sure about those accolades out there. Where was all this praise for the \"Indiana Jones\" films? Maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language? Still enjoy it for what it is... a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it. I like the way you write Quentin! This is a fun movie! Great acting, great soundtrack, great editing and great story! The scenes in the big house...top class! Every scene with Leonardo diCaprio was amazing! Now my problems with the movie: the main meat of the movie, the mid section, dragged on a little too long and some of the dialogue was a bit dull but it was necessary to tell the story. The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn\\'t expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn\\'t complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...9/10. An Entertaining Mess Modern exploitation guru Quentin Tarantino serves up historical revenge once again. His last film, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, had the German Nazis getting theirs, and now, with a good German on board (in fact he\\'s the villain from the last film) we\\'re out to set things right in the American Deep South, two years shy of the Civil War\\x85 Although the first half takes place on the road from Texas to Mississippi as bounty hunting dentist Dr. King Schultz recruits a slave named Django to help him find three outlaw brothers (Django alone knows their appearance). These are the more spirited and deliciously cutthroat segments as our heroes partner up and, as Django puts it, \"Kill white people for money.\" Christoph Waltz (Schultz) and Jamie Foxx (Django) are a good team, and while making mince meat out of their targets, the bloodshed is something to marvel. But Tarantino throws in awkward bouts of humor, derailing the intensity of the moment. One particular scene where a group of rednecks complain about not seeing through masked eyeholes (including a very distracting cameo by Jonah Hill) feels like Mel Brooks clumsily intruding Sergio Leone.After Django helps Schultz with his job, it\\'s time for the doctor to aid his more-than-capable partner rescue Django\\'s wife Broomhilda, who resides at \"Candyland,\" an infamous Antebellum plantation run by the sinister though much too youthful Calvin Candie.While Leonardo DiCaprio has more than capable acting skills, and savors the gloriously tyrannical racist dialog, there could have/should have been a backstory on why the owner of a plantation looks fresh out of finishing school.For a man who\\'s supposed to have a lifetime of seething venom oozing from his veins, those desperately piercing blue eyes seem more confused and frustrated than cold and calculating, making Tarantino\\'s purposely overboard racism more of a crutch than weapon for the DiCaprio character (perhaps Don Johnson, who played a wily brothel owner in a previous scene, could have taken this role\\x85 he had the age going for him and with that, soulless eyes that look like he\\'s seen ‚Äì and been through ‚Äì pretty much everything).But Leo\\'s not alone. He\\'s helped along by the most wicked of Uncle Tom\\'s played by Samuel Jackson, whose spitefully cantankerous Stephen figures things out before his boss. This is a nice role for the QT stock actor, who has sleepwalked through many roles post PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN. Although his feeble mannerisms often slow down the performance.The main problem with UNCHAINED is how long Tarantino stretches scenes with dialog. While the actors, especially Waltz and DiCaprio, have a blast with colorful monologues, you\\'ll often forget there are other characters on board ‚Äì and most of the speeches fail to serve the plot. That being: the duo pretending to buy Mandingo slave fighters when they really want the girl.With all the deals and discussions going on, the much-anticipated reunion of Django and Broomhilda is lost in the mix. Not even Django\\'s surreptitious trigger finger (whenever she\\'s treated badly) adds worthy suspense, which, during this overlong stint at Candyland, is very much needed.But there\\'s not all downtime at the mansion: a particular Candie lecture involving a slave\\'s skull does successfully perk things up, providing DiCaprio a good five minutes of sheer unapologetic villainy. Then, after a shocking twist, it\\'s Django alone who must save his girl.Jamie Foxx, having played a quietly brooding second fiddle to Waltz so far, makes up for lost time with heated gusto. This third and final act involving a group of Australians being duped by Django, who\\'s learned the art of waxing poetic, is replete with the bare-knuckle action we\\'ve anticipated all along: although the large chunks of bloody guts flying off each gunshot victim seems like Tarantino doing an imitation of himself. There are some really neat montage sequences and beautiful locations, but some of the music, especially that of the rap nature, seems too modern for the time portrayed. And the editing feels somewhat limp without QT\\'s longtime collaborator Sally Menke, who died a few years back: Particular flashbacks and hallucinations are often confusing and awkward.A pretty good ride, much better than Quentin\\'s last two films (BASTERDS and DEATH PROOF), yet there needed a much tighter/sharper vehicle for our title hero to deserve the fanfare of the literally explosive finale.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com Tarantino... I am disappointed I am a hardcore Tarantino fan and I must say I had great expectations for this movie. I can now honestly say that in my opinion Django Unchained is Tarantino\\'s worst film to this day. Lets start with the first major flaw. The soundtrack. Usually Tarantino has great taste for his soundtracks and on most of his movies (pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, kill bill) it actually is a fundamental part and complements the film. On Django it seems that Mr. Tarantino got Lil Wayne to choose some of the tracks. Hip Hop in a western?? Completely ruined the movie for me. Second, the length of the movie is ridiculously long... Almost 3 hours. Usually films of such lengths have intricate plot lines and/or are made to tell an exceptionally long story. Not in this case. The movie could have easily been 100 minutes long. If it wasn\\'t for the excessive and unnecessary dialogues, the useless KKK scene, the first 45 minutes of the movie which have almost nothing to do with the main plot line. The last 30 minutes of bloodshed serve to no use and I guess is just a fetish of the director. Mr. Tarantino seems to lose the sense of time and you can never tell where his ego ends and the plot begins.Third, bad acting. Jamie Foxx is impalpable. Besides a few punch lines and some dramatic moments Foxx doesn\\'t portray the slave from the pre-civil war era but mostly comes off as a thug from the hood. Di Caprio is too pretty-faced to seriously be the villain in this movie and if it wasn\\'t for the horrors happening around the character (Candie) you could hardly tell he\\'s the bad guy. Waltz and Jackson on the other hand with their excellent performances keep this movie together. I was really hoping Tarantino, with such an all-star cast, could have pulled off a both socially relevant and at the same time entertaining film, but again I was mistaken. Loved it! It\\'s a hit. Absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I\\'m not too crazy about Tarantino\\'s movies, but this one is definitely the best one I\\'ve seen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was a bit skeptical and thought I\\'d end up leaving an hour into the movie (it\\'s a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn\\'t even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid to miss something. I\\'m usually very particular about the movies, nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5. Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I\\'ve done some more research on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this film! Freedom and Choices and Tarantino In Quentin Tarantino\\'s Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear. Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You\\'re gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can\\'t believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit‚Äîan all blue with white ruffle get-up. It\\'s a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It\\'s a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It\\'s an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way‚Äîwatch out, here I come, I ain\\'t gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film‚Äîit wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick‚Äîthat\\'s why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It\\'s been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it\\'s Tarantino at his most epic. Brace yourself for True Tarantino Quentin Tarantino\\'s 8th film \"Django Unchained\" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would\\'ve approve of this movie. It\\'s designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you\\'re in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django\\'s wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can\\'t deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for \"Ray\", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can\\'t be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino\\'s entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for \"Inglorious Basterds\". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn\\'t go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino\\'s dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. \"Django Unchained\" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that\\'s entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It\\'s not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it\\'s one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don\\'t ya think? ',\n",
       " 'Inception': 'A one-of-a-kind mind-blowing masterpiece! My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who\\'ve rarely slept without dream, it\\'s so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it\\'s been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it\\'s been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan\\'s remarkable works: Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I\\'ve ever seen. But overall, it doesn\\'t reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven\\'t been able to find the very particular \"Nolan\\'s spirit\" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan\\'s nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience\\'s mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception. SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven\\'t watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there\\'s technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target\\'s subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person\\'s subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito\\'s biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who\\'s dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father\\'s business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer\\'s mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb\\'s past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb\\'s case, it\\'s the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We\\'re now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn\\'t even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn\\'t care any more, what\\'s important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life. Some short lines about the cast: Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe\\'s performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn\\'t have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie. Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah. I\\'d like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what\\'s coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it\\'s hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I\\'m afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers! Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is? You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen. I don\\'t see it often, in case it\\'s not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this. Inception was only less shocking to me than the Matrix When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don\\'t matter. Generation defining. The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking. Insanely Brilliant ! Nolan has outdone himself !! What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood\\'s most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he\\'s increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: \\'Inception\\'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb\\'s \\'brainiac\\' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don\\'t just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the \\'Best Director\\' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it\\'s also a metaphorical one: It\\'s hard not to draw connections between Cobb\\'s dream-weaving and Nolan\\'s film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards. Answering all the questions with one answer: I feel guilt. ‚≠ê When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it\\'s twist. I\\'m not gonna mention details, because can\\'t share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. \"Why he is keeping her in his dreams?\" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That\\'s why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You\\'re waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great. Inception has a lot of ideas and it doesn\\'t do anything with them I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it\\'s already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I\\'ll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I\\'ll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that \"shocking ending\" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It\\'s not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don\\'t want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer\\'s (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can\\'t return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb\\'s main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn\\'t get a chance to see the kids\\' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio\\'s father-in-law. Why doesn\\'t Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn\\'t he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It\\'s a long distance relationship but it\\'s something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character\\'s main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you\\'ve seen Shutter Island, You\\'ve seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island\\x85 it\\'s all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy\\'s mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it\\'s impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb\\'s team has to get inside someone\\'s mind ‚Äì which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn\\'t enough, there is Ellen page\\'s character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I\\'m fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It\\'s the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy\\'s mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don\\'t care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren\\'t high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I\\'m only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I\\'m not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe\\'s character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don\\'t give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don\\'t tell us what consequences it would have, they don\\'t show us what happens with the company, they don\\'t do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn\\'t like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer\\'s unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn\\'t really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I\\'ll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here\\'s the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it\\'s stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it\\'s a stupid cop out on Nolan\\'s part. An excuse for all the things that didn\\'t make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience. Good idea lost in the noise The central idea of \"Inception\" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people\\'s dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, \"Inception\" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a caf√© in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What\\'s going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that\\'s the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn\\'t nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it\\'s time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that\\'s never gonna happen, but it\\'s *my* dream.) Inception; Christopher Nolan\\'s masterpiece? Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people\\'s minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as \"a film that rewards intellect\", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan\\'s previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It\\'s a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent. My number one favorite movie Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It\\'s absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie! Mindcraft... There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They\\'ve been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.Imaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies. Didn\\'t win Best Picture? WHAT? Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it\\'s kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they\\'re completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn\\'t enough, watching it twice isn\\'t enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it\\'s greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It\\'s like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it\\'s the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don\\'t nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it\\'s David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I\\'d place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon... In a Decade, \"Inception\" May Be A Religion Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. \"Inception\" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. \"The Matrix\" (1999), \"The Cell\" (2000), \"Abre Los Ojos\" (1997) & its American remake \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001)), you really can\\'t look away, nor should you.\"Inception\" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people\\'s subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person\\'s mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the \"Matrix\" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It\\'s especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I\\'ve never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn\\'t good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don\\'t get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I\\'ve seen are confusing at first. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is a film I\\'ve seen a couple of times, and still don\\'t understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I\\'m positive this movie will. It\\'s an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater. Perfect for Sci-Fi Fans Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Inception\" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people\\'s secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor\\'s son, Robert Fischer\\'s, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito\\'s business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone\\'s mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call \"inception.\" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb\\'s return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer\\'s sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb\\'s wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I\\'ve gone over the plot, let\\'s talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says \"Inception\" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of \"Dark Knight,\" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD\\'s most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan\\'s movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy\\'s role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD\\'s most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie \"The Matrix\" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan\\'s directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film. Insulting I will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews. I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there\\'s so many embarrassing clich√©s (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there\\'s the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment. Nolan at his most intelligent best. Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan\\'s mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it\\'s storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn\\'t expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don\\'t worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it\\'s high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb\\'s emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she\\'s the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige\\'s cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we\\'ve still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3. Intellectual masterpiece Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn\\'t win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I\\'ve seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won\\'t be disappointed. Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement! I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i\\'ll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that\\'s hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely\\'ll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won\\'t happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren\\'t all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it\\'s not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan\\'s latest masterpiece! My Grade won\\'t change-it\\'s the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10! Amazing Directing, Captivating Plot, Overall Great I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio\\'s films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It\\'s great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you\\'re thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i\\'ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn\\'t afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending. Nolan\\'s first true masterpiece Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan\\'s Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn\\'t like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film. I\\'m nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn\\'t follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can\\'t help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it\\'s either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan\\'s perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can\\'t explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It\\'s like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film\\'s humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That\\'s right, years.Once the film ends, you\\'ll want to watch it again, for there\\'s something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film\\'s ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can\\'t seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie\\'s quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer\\'s complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that\\'s really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film\\'s point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent) The perfect summer blockbuster? What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don\\'t look for...brains! \"What is the most resilient parasite? An idea\" says Leonardo Di Caprio\\'s character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It\\'s all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around \"Extractors\", who are paid to extract secrets from people\\'s subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, \"Inception\" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film\\'s genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan\\'s script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio\\'s other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese\\'s film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan\\'s film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it\\'s OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen! All right..... The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice \"inception\" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we\\'re \"treated\" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy\\'s character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe\\'s character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don\\'t buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio\\'s dream world.This isn\\'t a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan\\'s films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like \"Total Recall\" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one. You are not as stupid as Christopher Nolan thinks you are. Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The \"learning about the dream world\" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page\\'s characters already knew what was being explained. The similar \"learning about the matrix\" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There\\'s another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That\\'s it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let\\'s not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor\\'s bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don\\'t need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a \"physical\" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn\\'t even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo\\'s goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn\\'t even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He\\'s separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn\\'t happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he\\'s crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo\\'s lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a \\'so what?\\' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn\\'t send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It\\'s integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That\\'s why I don\\'t believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else\\'s dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The \\'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning\\' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It\\'s getting as bad as that tired old \\'It\\'s all a dream\\' scenario. Oh, wait... ',\n",
       " 'Gladiator': 'They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man\\'s skull with one hand. Ridley Scott\\'s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I\\'m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe\\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen\\'s turn here against that of Diane Kruger\\'s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that\\'s inspiring.I didn\\'t know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men\\'s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10 One of the best films ever There are so many iconic lines and quips in this film, too many to countIt was easily the best film of the start of the millennium.\"on my mark, unleash hell!\"\"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the TRUE emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.\" As a matter of fact, Maximus, I AM entertained. Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He\\'s the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that\\'s what a good gladiator match should be. 20 Years On, It Still Rewards And Grips 20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There\\'s so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer\\'s iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott\\'s superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the clich√©\\'s that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film\\'s status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips. Timeless. A modern day classic. Epitome of an epic. An all-time great. \"Are you not entertained?!?!\"One of the most perfect movies ever made. The pacing, the characterization & development. Hans Zimmer\\'s score. John Mathieson\\'s cinematography. Career-making acting from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, & Djimon Hounsou. Everything is on point.This movie is an integral part of Ridley Scott\\'s holy trinity, along with Blade Runner & Alien. Endlessly rewatchable. Endlessly quotable. An epic tragedy on the level of Shakespeare & Ancient Greece.This movie will be just as popular a hundred years from now, and no movie about Ancient Rome will have topped it. Why don\\'t they make films like this anymore Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film Spellbinding. One of the best films of a generation, it\\'s a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I\\'m concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he\\'s awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10. Are you entertained? Yes sir yes I am How good is Russell Crowe though, easily one of my favourite actors. Joaquin Phoenix play the role of a little weasel very well. Absolute classic of a film. Great Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people\\'s champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer\\'s score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. \"Are you not entertained?!\" Breathtaking! Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it\\'s awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself! A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better The beginning of \"Gladiator\" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. \"Get on with it,\" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn\\'t have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn\\'t have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn\\'t have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn\\'t think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn\\'t make me think about anything; it didn\\'t challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn\\'t make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don\\'t get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that \"Gladiator\" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10. Amazing movie This movie is amazing, every soul should see this, Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar A+ action film, C- epic In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus\\'s sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it\\'s hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It\\'s very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it\\'s far from the great film it\\'s widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from \"Fall of the Roman Empire\" (settings and characters), \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur\" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically \"Braveheart\" in a toga.Perhaps I\\'m just not enthralled by the film\\'s basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of \"Braveheart\", \"The Patriot\", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn\\'t a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he\\'s just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don\\'t fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about \"Fall of the Roman Empire\" is Christopher Plummer\\'s portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He\\'s not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it\\'s the script or Joaquin Phoenix\\'s acting, this film\\'s Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn\\'t come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield\\'s duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of \"Spartacus\".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo\\'s gladiators \"upset\" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the \"Tigress of Gaul\" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It\\'s impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus\\'s entry into Rome) but in other parts it\\'s murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer\\'s score is haunting and helps drive the film\\'s more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he\\'s a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren\\'t particularly compelling either.\"Gladiator\" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I\\'m afraid.7/10 Worst \"historical\" movie ever I remember watching this film when I was maybe 12, and I loved it. Now, 8 years later, I rewatched it (extended edition) and realised how awful this movie really is. I hope I\\'m not nitpicking, because it felt to me that the points I am going to make were there just to insult the viewers intelligence. -First major battle scene. Romans have siege weapons just lying around, on the front line of Germania? They are obviously hard to transport, and there is no reason for them to be there. -Crowe says later that there were roughly 10,000 roman soldiers on the battlefield, with 2,000 dead. Thats funny because I could probably count the number of roman soldiers who were shown to have died on 1 hand, whereas the number of barbarians killed was massive. -Crowe says the casualties sustained by the cavalry by the siege weapons were necessary, then does nothing but complain about how many of his men died. -Russell Crowe sneaks out of the fort with his cavalry and somehow manages to encircle thousands of barbarians, without them ever noticing. Also, the barbarians just stand there and allow this to happen. -The choice of softly spoken British accents for the romans was awful. I\\'m not saying they should of spoken in full Latin, but that is no reason for them to speak in those annoying accents. -After the battle, the emperor, the emperors son and his daughter are all within maybe a days ride of the Germanian front line? That makes no sense, why would such important figures be there at all? -Crowe is described as Rome\\'s best general by Caesar, yet he is Spanish, lives on a farm and has no involvement in politics. -Caesar says he is close to death, yet he journeyed from Rome presumably to the front line of Germania. Why didn\\'t he stay in Rome? -Caesar bestows Crowe with the title of Protector of Rome, a man who is Spanish, has little interest or skill in politics and wants nothing more than to go home. Good choice Caesar. -Crowe\\'s slave(he\\'s never called a slave) has a Scottish accent. Is this a nod to the Eagle of the Ninth? Simple stealing of idea because they thought it would work in the Roman context? Or just bad historical accuracy? Also, they are in Germania, so why would there be a Scottish slave there? There isn\\'t any mention of Crowe serving in Britannia. -I can understand Crowe being depicted as an indestructible badass, but seriously, the dude can throw swords that accurately? -Crowe somehow manages to ride from the front line in Germania(which kind of suggests deep in Germania), to Spain, just in time to just miss his wife and son\\'s murderers? Impossible. The farm was still smoking when he got there for god\\'s sake. -After that funny scene where he\\'s covered in snot after finding his wife and son, he\\'s picked up by apparently African slave traders (Carthaginians?). A roman citizen, in a roman province, abducted by slave traders? I don\\'t think I need to explain myself anymore. -So Crowe apparently has an SPQR tattoo, something never practised by Romans at all. The only people who would tattoo themselves were barbarians. So I got 45 minutes in than I gave up. I\\'ll probably get a lot of stick for this review, but I really don\\'t care. If you are looking for a good historically accurate movie with a plot that makes sense I cannot stress enough how frustrated you will be watching this movie. If you have no knowledge of the Roman civilization at all and you are willing to look past all the glaring plot holes and bad accents, there is a lot you will enjoy about this movie. It is full of action and Crowe is a badass. The reason I didn\\'t give this 1 out of 10 is because there were a few enjoyable battle/fight scenes where you could forget about all the stupidness that had occurred for a few minutes. Other than that, there is nothing stopping this from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Can\\'t be missed! \"Gladiator\" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score \\x96 it is truly a \"complete\" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less \"popular\" artists who also deserve a big \"bravo\". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for \"Gladiator\" is brilliant \\x96 and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.\"Gladiator\" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven\\'t gone and watched it \\x96 I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now! Both Old-Fashioned And Modern, Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama Gladiator, 2000\\'s Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott\\'s Roman blockbuster doesn\\'t have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood\\'s past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus\\' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe\\'s performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don\\'t get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator\\'s visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott\\'s version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It\\'s as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there\\'s a modern feeling to Ridley Scott\\'s filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott\\'s world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott\\'s emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can\\'t say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott\\'s direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing \\'Elysium\\' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film\\'s best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It\\'s visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100 A nail biting, intense modern epic! Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can\\'t feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott\\'s case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he\\'s in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus\\' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott\\'s camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS! Edge of Your Seat Fun! Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the \"general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.\" Crowe\\'s intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the \"thrill of the Coliseum\" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time! Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery! Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director\\'s artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he\\'s done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox. One of the Greatest Movies I have Ever Seen This is wonderful storytelling. The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests. I went back to see the film again. The first time I didn\\'t hear anything Crowe said before the battle. I was just too visually caught-up. The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus \"what we do in life... echoes in eternity.\" Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor. I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie. I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to \"find himself,\" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film. One was the afterlife. Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone. Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing. It actually had me wanting to believe that\\'s the way Rome actually looked in all it\\'s glory. The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional. The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus\\' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent. Visually and emotionally satisfying. Cecil B DeMille eat your heart out The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century\\'s answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - \"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor\".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena\\'s, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as \"The Spaniard\".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of \\'blockbuster\\' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of \\'internationally casted films\\'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \"should have been a son\" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is \\'right\\'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see. Adequate Roman Epic There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla\\'s introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10. Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . . The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor\\'s son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a \"sword-and-sandal\" movie. I wasn\\'t sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that\\'s for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn\\'t show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming. The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome. In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good. Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he\\'s a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with. (It\\'s really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It\\'s true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, \"only better\"), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend. Victory of production over a lousy script There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn\\'t matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... \"Gladiator\" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don\\'t speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it\\'s a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It\\'s taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it\\'s unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it\\'s a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn\\'t know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile \"husband of the dead wife\" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it\\'s a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general\\'s family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn\\'t follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level \"Gladiator\" plays out like a remake of \"Fall of a Roman Empire\". But it\\'s not in the script. It\\'s in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there\\'s a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn\\'t yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes. Worst \"historical\" film ever If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don\\'t watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn\\'t have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in \"braveheart\", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn\\'t charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III. ',\n",
       " 'Interstellar': '7 years later Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant. I waited 5 years to watch it again After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE Out of this world A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You\\'ll either love this one or you won\\'t. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It\\'s just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It\\'s not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it\\'s the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it\\'s heading (no pun intended), but it doesn\\'t change the fact that it\\'s beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It\\'s the best possible way this could go, even if it\\'s not in our grasps just yet ... A visual and auditory marvel Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth‚Äîcrops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie\\'s sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer\\'s harmonies captivated watchers\\' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven\\'t encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor\\'s performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that. Masterpiece Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10\\'s.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing. Best movie I have seen in my life This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn\\'t get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100. Masterpiece A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time. Excellent Movie I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I\\'m not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you\\'re a critic, you\\'re not enjoying the movie because you\\'re too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn\\'t notice them! Possibly the best movie of all time I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that\\'s our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn\\'t look towards the stars and wonder, because that\\'s what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust... A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of \\'Inception\\' and \\'The Dark Knight\\', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, \\'Interstellar\\' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like \\'2001: A Space Odyssey\\' and \\'Apollo 13\\', \\'Interstellar\\' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can\\'t be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan\\'s epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema. Unmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan\\'s best directorial work I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with \\'Interstellar.\\' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans\\'s score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey\\'s acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan\\'s characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i\\'ve ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don\\'t think this is Nolan\\'s best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan\\'s most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick\\'s mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work. The best film I have ever seen All is amazing. I can\\'t describe anything. It\\'s a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies\\' lover and... This was awesome. A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it. Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he\\'s making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn\\'t seem likely that Cooper\\'s children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a \"ghost\" in Murphy\\'s bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth\\'s crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it\\'s a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That\\'s not even the half of it ‚Äì Nolan\\'s narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It\\'s shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can\\'t help wondering if it\\'s simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper\\'s crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that\\'s furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi\\'s Romilly and Wes Bentley\\'s Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn\\'t quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There\\'s no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It\\'s pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he\\'s ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she\\'s in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that\\'s true of the final product: Nolan\\'s film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story. Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful OK, I\\'ll keep this brief, but I\\'ll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved \"Interstellar\", but I didn\\'t for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won\\'t even bother with dissecting the \"science\" in the film, because that isn\\'t really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I\\'m not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I\\'ll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don\\'t a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn\\'t care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior \"Contact\"). The special effects aren\\'t special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won\\'t go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to \"A Perfect Storm\" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I\\'ve probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn\\'t doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, \"Contact\" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears. Glad i didn\\'t watch the trailer Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn\\'t believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :). I would rate 11/10 I hadn\\'t seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have Absolutely incredible; truly a must-watch It\\'s difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I\\'d go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you\\'ve experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn\\'t a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.This is a sci-fi film in which the \\'fi\\' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.I would be lying if I said I wasn\\'t highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn\\'t very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you\\'re watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn\\'t a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.I will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet. Nolan\\'s masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I\\'m sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn\\'t really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won\\'t spoil anything here; I\\'ll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he\\'s revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can\\'t be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can\\'t compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don\\'t live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don\\'t think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought. The best of all Time There is not even a single day I don\\'t think of this movie, it\\'s scenes , it has a profound impact on me and it shall remain with me forever. A journey across the galaxy to save humanity Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn\\'t believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I\\'d recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of \\'2001 ‚Äì A Space Odyssey\\'\\x85 although this has more emotion to it than that classic. You can\\'t find a better space movie than that! I love this dream movie so much. I have never seen a better movie than this one.A fantastic dream realized. The music was outstanding, and the acting and directing were tremendous.This fantastic film should be seen by everyone! What a massive disappointment Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and \\'Inception\\', though, with the exception of \\'Insomnia\\', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris \\'less than meets the eye\\'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with \\'Memento\\' and \\'Inception\\' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of \\'Interstellar\\'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like \\'Gravity\\' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the \\'starchild\\' at the end of \\'2001\\', he\\'d punch you in the nose. \\'Interstellar\\' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends \\'The Wizard of Oz\\' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word \\'awesome\\' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years. Mankind Achievement THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT? Bit too overrated I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories.There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn\\'t offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger. Seriously people?? I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it.Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this....Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here....
