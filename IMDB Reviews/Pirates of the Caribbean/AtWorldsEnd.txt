Good conclusion to the series, same problems as the 2nd

At World's End

Emotional Puzzle

I enjoyed this movie
This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing.
Not bad

Hear me out: the best movie of the whole series.

Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End

Best out of the "pirates" trilogy...I'm not disappointed!
I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments. I still had pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed! The plot was brilliant and very creative, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As always, the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant... Anyways, overall, just a really great film. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (and you know how good those are!) See it, you won't be disappointed!
A reasonably fitting "end"

Why all the harsh reviews? This was a great finale!

Not so bad, but overall it is a rather disappointing second sequel.
I will say I absolutely loved Curse of the Black Pearl, it's one of my all-time favourite movies. Dead Mens Chest was enjoyable and lively, if overlong. At World's End is certainly not a terrible film, far from it, I just found it rather disappointing that's all, plot-wise being the least remarkable of the three films. I will say there is a lot to recommend it, namely the art direction, and the special effects weren't too bad either. The cinematography was impressive, there is some lovely period detail and I thought there were some very well staged battle sequences. The music by Hans Zimmer, one of my favourite film composers, was outstanding, very rousing and dramatic. And the performances weren't so bad either- Jack Sparrow is still the lovable rogue we have come to know and love, and Johnny Depp played him marvellously. A very talented actor, Geoffrey Rush, sinks his teeth into the part of Captain Barbosa, I particularly loved the line, "I'm a bit busy at the moment." And Bill Nighy was delightfully villainous as Davy Jones. However, the film does have flaws that prevents it from being the rollicking film it had the potential of being. The plot did take a while to get going, and sometimes became unfocused and convoluted, like Elizabeth and Will declaring their wedding vows in the middle of a big fight. Also there are a lot of characters, and one or two of them served no real purpose to the plot, and a lot was crammed into the long running time, so at the end of the day, it felt a bit bloated. The script was full of existing jokes, not necessarily a bad thing, but overall it lacked freshness, and the humour and fun, that made me love the first film so much. Overall, it is certain performances, fantastic music and some well-staged battles that salvage an otherwise bloated and disappointing second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox
Great film lives up to expectations.
This movie is truly spectacular!!! Non stop action, with a surprising ending. If it weren't for the silliness of the Jack Sparrow clones, I would give it a 9 and 1/2. It takes a little away from the film's momentum. As far as the final battle rivaling that of the LOTR trilogy, I would say no. This trilogy will go down as one of the great trilogies. Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better. As always, be sure to stick around after the credits for an extra scene. This one adds to the plot of the film and gives viewers some closure after a heart wrenching finale. Make sure you check this film out.
Not bad
I liked this movie a little bit more than the 2nd one, "Dead Man's Chest". The plot was a bit confusing at times, and they tried to cram way too much story into the movie (it's a 2 hr 40 minute movie), but in the end, it was entertaining and fun to watch. The acting from Johnny Depp is good as usual, and the action/CGI sequences are even more breathtaking than the previous 2 movies. They throw in some good laughs throughout the movie, though sometimes the situations are a bit more absurd than they should be (especially near the end). All in all, a good "adventure novel" type movie to watch. If you liked the first 2 movies, you'll like this one. Oh yeah, stay till the end of the credits for a good scene.
I wanted to like it, but...

Give this movie a chance!

Wow-ho wow-ho!
First of all I warn you: do not focus too much on the plot. There are some things you won't like, for the most of you a few things, for a few of you most things. But this is not a movie you'll love for its plot. You're going to love for its special effects better and better from the first chapter of the trilogy (the final battle is a masterpiece!), and because in this movie there's fun, a lot of fun: jack/johnny is irresistible, Barbossa is a great pirate and all the crew (pintel and ragetti over every other one) is hilarious. I saw it yesterday, but I'm going to see it again and again. Why? Because when you're on your seat and the light come down, then begins a show you cannot dislike. A suggestion? Enjoy it!
Not a big fan of other 2, but loved this one

Entertaining, But Too Long

Despite its many flaws, the movie still left me hungry for more.

A good movie but sure isn't of Curse of the Black Pearl standard
OK, where to start. Pirates of the Caribbean, Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all time favourite movies, it was a great family adventure picture that could keep all ages entertained. Johnny Depp kept the film lighthearted, Keira Knightley brought a little something for the guys, Orlando Bloom was the "heart throb" for the girls and superb actors such as Jonathan Pryce and Geoffrey Rush filled up the ranks. This movie was near perfect and as a result people may have expected a little too much of the sequels. Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest has been critiqued by many a fan as being drawn out through the use of tiresome kraken scenes, although generally a solid film it was a disappointment in comparison to Curse Of The Black Pearl Now, Pirates of the Caribbean, World's End. Not a lighthearted family movie. Sure, Captain Jack is in it bringing his quirky comedy but even this does little to lift the spirits of a movie that appears to be declining rapidly into depressing squalor. The action scenes are great, the special effects are nothing short of astounding, watch Barbosa's pirate ship sailing the sea at night, absolutely beautiful. The performances given by the cast is commendable but...the storyline, cringe. Whilst not a complicated plot in itself, in fact in retrospect it is a very simple plot line, however, in the film this plot line becomes weighed down by poor explanation. So little time is given to fully explaining essential plot points that the film, although long, feels rushed along at a the speed of a freight train leaping from one scenario to another and back again. Davey Jones loses all credibility as the villain of the piece, a title that Verbinski seemed adamant about passing on to Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) but, whilst an obviously scheming character, Beckett is never really perceived as a villainous threat. What's more is that the Kraken is disposed of outside the realms of the film reel, thus making light out of the primary threat from Dead Man's Chest, one can't help but think that, although the Kraken scenes became tiresome in Dead Man's Chest, there should have been an overcoming the odds situation in which the Pirates destroyed this thing...afraid not. Instead we're treated to a washed up corpse of the Kraken on a beach having been told that **Spoiler** Jones was told to destroy the Kraken by Lord Beckett **End Spoiler** Geoffrey Rush gives another truly epic performance as Captain Barbosa, as did Johnny Depp with Captain Jack Sparrow, it's unfortunate that the film could not obtain the epic recognition that it's actors have claimed for themselves. An entertaining film with some laughs and some tears (if you're that way inclined), some astounding special effects and marvellously inventive action sequences, however, a disappointment in comparison with Pirates, Curse of the Black Pearl. An overcomplicated story with more twists than a pig's tail wasn't needed in this fantasy world, this film alienates the audience it was once aimed at, primarily children and family. The quick witted banter is toned down and a depressing mood is invested in most scenes, gone are the beautiful sandy beaches, gone is the sunshine, instead rain and whirlpools are the flavour of the day. The main theme music used in the previous instalments for the action scenes has also been replaced, in what I personally believe was a foolish move. If you're a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean then nothing I say will stop you seeing this movie, it has to be done, just... don't go in with high expectations, whilst this film doesn't seem as long as Dead Man's Chest it also fails to invest the charm of its predecessors into it's reels.
Pirates 3 Out of this World!
Do not listen to the stingy critics!! This movie is AMAZING! Everything you hoped for and more. I can't wait to see it again. The fact that it is a long movie makes it all the better for the viewer because you get more of all the adventure, romance and breathtaking scenes. The writing is incredible, the acting is the best it has been since the beginning, and the artistry is second-to-none. There is no fluff, every scene means something. It's funny, intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My heart didn't stop pounding until long after the credits ended. It's the kind of movie that stays with you. It's satisfying IF this is the last Pirates, and it leaves you wanting more IF we are to be blessed with a fourth. Bottom line is: go see this movie, and have a great time doing it!
World's still the same, there's just less in it

Nobody move! I've dropped me brain!

More enjoyable than I imagined, but still not as fun as the first film

robbed by pirates :(
