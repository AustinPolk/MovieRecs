An absolutely incredible film!

Thank you Mr Jackson
(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.

First, And Still The Best Of LOTR

Masterpiece

I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life.

Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...

An amazing beginning of the trilogy. An amazing end of the movie.

Unbelievably Good That Stands The Test Of Time

Near perfect adaptation of a fantasy benchmark

Great spectacle, bad script

But it could have been so much more...

Embrace the magic

We May Have Forgotten Just How Good This Is
It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.
Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film

One of the best films ever made.

Absolute game changer
Absolutely epic! The scale is truly mind blowing. Every filmmaking aspect is beyond incredible. Especially the score, set design & dialogue. The emotional weight & amazing battles seal it.
The Fantasy Motion Picture to Rule Them All...

The First Installment of the Greatest Trilogy
The beginning of the greatest trilogy started with the Fellowship. The music, the landscapes, the characters, and of course the story, all come together in perfect melody. Tolkien created this magical world and story, but Jackson brought it to us in a way we never thought possible. And the best part was... there were two more movies after this.
"Remember what Bilbo used to say, it's dangerous business Frodo, going out the door."

One of the greatest films of all time.

Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10
While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10
"it has some interesting elements"
A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch Â– at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.
